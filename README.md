Comprehensive analysis of factors influencing diaper sales across retail outlets in Naples, aiming to estimate the potential revenue. The team, consisting of management engineers  and computer science and electronics engineers, conducted exploratory data analysis using various datasets. The datasets included socio-demographic insights, store attributes, and spatial data for geographic analysis. The team emphasized the importance of understanding these factors for developing effective marketing strategies and optimizing sales potential. 
Overview of Datasets 
As there were 4 data sets provided for challenges which contribute gravitational data sets which consists of microcode psuedo value 2 type of datatype one was based on weekday and weekend basis and other one descibes about the population of place based on age category

Data Integration
Merging the tables using microcode as the primary key  to the store data.
Assigning microcodes based on spatial relationship: If a store's location lies within a polygon, the corresponding microcode from the polygons_data dataframe is retrieved and assigned to the store's "microcode" column.

What are the insights gained from the exploratory data analysis on store potential and population demographics?
 
The exploratory data analysis provided valuable insights into store potential and population demographics.
It quantified store attractiveness based on factors such as proximity to key points of interest, allowing for the identification of stores with high sales potential. 
Additionally, the analysis offered socio-demographic insights into the local population, which is crucial for estimating diaper demand. 
The average store potential distribution across various clusters identified through K-means clustering enabled interactive exploration and analysis of potential patterns.
Furthermore, the analysis delved into mean population visiting stores by day-wise and day-wise time-slot, providing a comprehensive understanding of the demographic trends. 
These insights are essential for retailers to develop effective marketing strategies and optimize sales potential based on the characteristics of the local population and store attractiveness.

What are the key factors influencing diaper sales across retail outlets in Naples?
 
The key factors influencing diaper sales across retail outlets in Naples include socio-demographic data, territorial features, and points of interest near stores.
Understanding these factors is crucial for developing effective marketing strategies and optimizing sales potential.
Additionally, factors such as store attractiveness based on proximity to key points of interest, socio-demographic insights into the local population, store size, parking availability, store type, and
the presence of high-performing stores such as LIDL and SAPORI & DINTORNI are also influential in determining diaper sales potential. 
The document suggests a potential relationship between store size and sales potential, as well as the importance of parking availability and store type in optimizing store potential revenue. 
By addressing these factors strategically, retailers can enhance their store performance and overall revenue potential.
